# Random Theology Quote Generator
## Team Treehouse Techdegree Project1

This was a random quote generator that was developed and submitted as part of the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree curriculum from Team Treehouse.
A random quote with additional elements will appear on the screen whenever the user clicks the 'show another quote' button.
There is also an interval timer that will show another quote and background color every 10 seconds.  There is conditional logic to hide elements if the randomly selected quote object does not have that property.  

## Languages:
* **HTML**: Starter HTML was provided by Treehouse.  I made slight modifications on this to to include an image, changed title, changed header, etc.
* **CSS**: Started CSS was provided by Treehouse.  I made slight modifications to the CSS to alter the image into a small, rounded headshot.  
* **JavaScript**: Was provided with a starter eventlistener by Treehouse.  I altered this to trigger multiple functions instead of just one.  The rest of the Javascript was written from scratch by myself.
